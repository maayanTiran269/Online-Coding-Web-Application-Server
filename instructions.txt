Help Tom create an online coding web application with the following pages and features:
-   Lobby page (no need for authentication) :
        - The page should contain the title “Choose code block” and a list of at least 4 items that represent
          code blocks, each item can be represented by a name (for example - “Async case”)
        - Clicking on an item should redirect users to the corresponding code block page
-   Code block page :
        - Contains the "title" and a "text editor with the code block initial template" and a "role indicator (student/mentor)".
        - Have a “solution” on a codeblock object (also insert manually), once the student changes the code to be equal to the solution,
          show a big smiley face on the screen :)
        *Assume that "the first user who opens the code block page is the mentor" (Tom), after that, "any other client will be counted 
         as a student."
        *If Tom leaves the code-block page, students should be redirected to the lobby page, and any written code should be deleted.
        *The mentor will see the selected code block in a read-only mode.
        *The student will see the code block with the ability to change the code
        *Code changes should be displayed in real-time (Socket)
        *The code should have syntax highlighting At any given time 
        *each user can see how many students are in the room

General guidelines:
* Code blocks should be stored in a database of your choice (Relational or Not-Relational)
* The initial state of the database should contain at least four code blocks which can be created manually.
* Add clear comments to the code where needed.
* The task "requires" the development of a "client", "server", "database". 
* The "client side must be" implemented using "React", while the "server" side can be built with "any framework or language" of your choice.
